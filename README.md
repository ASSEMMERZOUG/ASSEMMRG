Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This Website showcases my learning journey, technical skills, projects, certifications, and career aspirations in the field of cybersecurity. It serves as a digital CV to demonstrate my growth and passion for securing critical systems and networks ^ ^

About Me
Hi! My name is ASSEM, and I am a cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to learning and applying best practices to protect systems and data. Currently, I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering, while focusing on penetration testing/Malware engineering and overall security research.

Current Role: Student
Passion: I have a strong interest in penetration testing and helping companies enhance their security posture. Sometimes, I participate in bug bounty programs && CTF chalenges and stay updated on the latest security trends.
Fun Facts: When I'm not working on cybersecurity, I enjoy training, 3D creation, Video Editing, and exploring new technologies.

Technical Skills
Tools:
Network Analysis: Wireshark, tcpdump Penetration Testing: Metasploit, Burp Suite, Cobalt Strike, Kali, Nikto,nmap Malware Analysis: IDA Pro, Ghidra, Hybrid Analysis, Volatility, Cuckoo Sandbox
SIEM Tools: Splunk, ELK Stack, Graylog, AlienVault
Cloud Security Tools: AWS Inspector, Azure Security Center, Google Cloud Security Command Center
Web Application Security Tools: AWVS,Nessus

Programming Languages:
html/css
Python
Bash
Javascript
c
ARM && X86 Assembly


Concepts and Frameworks:
1.Vulnerability Management: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in systems and networks
2.Incident Response Lifecycle: Detection, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned 
3.Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Security measures integrated into each phase of software development
4.Networking (TCP/IP, Firewalls, VPN, DNS): Understanding and securing network protocols, configuring and maintaining firewalls, securing virtual private networks (VPNs)
5.Threat Intelligence: Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating actionable information regarding potential cyber threats
6.Risk Management: Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to systems and data, followed by implementation of mitigation measures
7.Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): Identifying and defending against prolonged and targeted cyberattacks 
8.Red Team / Blue Team Exercises: Offensive (Red) and defensive (Blue) security practices to simulate and defend against real-world attacks
9.Social Engineering: Manipulating people to gain unauthorized access to systems or data
10.Zero Trust Architecture: Designing systems with the assumption that threats exist both inside and outside the network

Certifications and Training
Below are my completed and ongoing certifications, along with additional training and platforms I use to enhance my cybersecurity skills and also certs i plan on getting in the near future:

Certifications:
CompTIA Security+ (In Progress)
Certified Information Security Professional (CISP) (In Progress)
HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist(CPTS) (In Progress)
OSCP (Next)
CEH (Next)

Training and Platforms:
Hack The Box (HTB):
Active member of HTB, solving real-world penetration testing challenges and improving my hands-on hacking skills.
Completed multiple machines in categories like web exploitation, privilege escalation, and reverse engineering.

TryHackMe:
Regularly practice cybersecurity scenarios and labs to gain practical experience.

OWASP Top 10 Workshop:
Hands-on workshop focused on web application security vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10.
Explored real-world examples of SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Insecure Deserialization.

Cybersecurity by Cisco Networking Academy:
Learned the basic principles of cybersecurity, including cryptography, network defense, and threat intelligence.

Project Experience
Below are two key projects that I have completed to demonstrate my practical skills in cybersecurity:

Challenges:
Malware Analysis: Understanding obfuscation techniques used by advanced malware.
Incident Response: Developing speed and accuracy in identifying and responding to threats.
Improvement Plan:
Continue practicing malware analysis by working with real-world samples in a safe lab environment.
Enroll in advanced courses on incident response and forensic analysis.
Participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges to hone practical skills.

Career Objective
My ultimate goal is to become a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Threat Analyst or Penetration Tester. I aim to specialize in proactive threat hunting, vulnerability management, and helping organizations secure their digital infrastructure.
